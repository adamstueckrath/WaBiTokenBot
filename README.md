# WaBiTokenBot
I was tired of Reddit crypto FUD (fear, uncertainity, and doubt) about WaBi. So I created a bot to upvote submissions about WaBi, and to reply to comments with information about the company (Walimai). If a user on reddit writes !WaBi in a comment, the bot will reply with the followinn information:

> ##### About WaBi Token
>
>Walimai, the company behind WaBi, is a company that develops solutions to ensure product authenticity. It places secure anti->counterfeit labels on consumer products in China and internationally.
>
>Walimai’s operations are mainly in China, which suffers from counterfeit in products such as baby formula, cosmetics, and >alcohol. In order to solve this problem and provide confidence for consumers, the company has developed RFID labels with >anti-reuse design, as well as mobile Apps that integrate with the labels.
>
>Walimai label is applied to the product at the point of origin and is scanned throughout the supply chain. After consumers >purchase the products, they can scan the items with Walimai app, which would then show whether the product is original and >the product’s previous locations and timestamp along the supply chain.
